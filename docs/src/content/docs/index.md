Welcome to the **Ambient Code Platform** -- a Kubernetes-native platform for running AI-powered agents that do real engineering work. Define a task, connect your repos and tools, and let an agent handle the rest.

## Get Started

New to ACP? Start here:

- **[What is Ambient?](/getting-started/)** -- Understand what the platform does and how it works.
- **[Quickstart (UI)](/getting-started/quickstart-ui/)** -- Create your first agent session through the web interface.
- **[Core Concepts](/getting-started/concepts/)** -- Learn about workspaces, sessions, integrations, and workflows.

## Learn

Dive deeper into the platform's building blocks:

- **[Workspaces](/concepts/workspaces/)** -- Multi-tenant project containers for organizing sessions and teams.
- **[Sessions](/concepts/sessions/)** -- AI agent execution environments with chat, model settings, and artifact output.
- **[Integrations](/concepts/integrations/)** -- Connect GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Google Workspace.
- **[Context and Artifacts](/concepts/context-and-artifacts/)** -- Inputs agents work with and outputs they produce.
- **[Workflows](/concepts/workflows/)** -- Structured task templates for common engineering tasks.

## Workflows

Use built-in templates or bring your own:

- **[Bugfix](/workflows/bugfix/)** -- Diagnose and fix reported bugs.
- **[Triage](/workflows/triage/)** -- Classify, prioritize, and route issues.
- **[Spec-kit](/workflows/spec-kit/)** -- Generate technical specifications from requirements.
- **[PRD/RFE](/workflows/prd-rfe/)** -- Produce product requirements documents.
- **[Custom Workflows](/workflows/custom/)** -- Load workflows from any git repository.

## Extensions

- **[GitHub Action](/extensions/github-action/)** -- Trigger sessions from CI/CD pipelines.
- **[MCP Server](/extensions/mcp-server/)** -- Expose ACP capabilities via the Model Context Protocol.

## Ecosystem

- **[Amber](/ecosystem/amber/)** -- Secret management for agent sessions.
- **[AgentReady](/ecosystem/agentready/)** -- Prepare repositories for AI agent consumption.
